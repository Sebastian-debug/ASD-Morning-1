Hallo

testcommit HansJuergen

Start IntelliJ

Open

Choose Project "note" to open

Click Maven (right side of the IDE)

Note - Lifecycle - install (doubleclick)

If error occurs ->  sudo apt update

                    sudo apt install npm
                    
                    sudo npm install npm@latest -g
                    

After install go to Plugins -> spring-boot -> 

RIGHTCLICK spring-boot:run -> 4th entry (Blue M symbol - forgot name)

In the name field change to "RunNote" and press apply


Now u can press the green run-button in the IDE

When the application is running open http://localhost:8080/


When u change something in the code u have to press "install" again in the maven directory!
